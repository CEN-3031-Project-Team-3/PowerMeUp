# Getting Started

Welcome to our app! 

To get started clone the repository to your local machine, open a terminal window, navigate to the project directory, and run:
`npm install`
`npm start`

This will install all the required dependencies, and start the web app in a browser

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Developer Documentation

## Styling Tools

To create the UI of our app we used two different styling libraries. The first was [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). It provided us with a simple row column grid array to lay things out. The second library we used was [mui](https://mui.com/api/toggle-button-group/#main-content). The main reason for this library was its expansive selection of UI widgets and components. The `ToggleButtonGroup` component specifically gave us the form functionality that is present all throgughout our app.

## Design Architecture

We ended up going for a more quick and dirty approach with this app just to get things up and running, but The data and views are seperated as much as we were able to. All the different pages of the app are stored as components, Our frebase initialization and CRUD functionality is present inside two seperate utility files. And our data is stored within a singleton class.

## Navigation

For navigation we used the 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
We currently do not have any unit tests implimented, but are plannign on adding some in the future.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
